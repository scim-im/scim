	Fixed the problem when on FreeBSD scim-helper-module silently failed to launch.
	Added a workaround to module loading/unloading for some unknown problem of SEGV occuring after some module was unloaded in scim-helper-module.
	Improved error handling in scim-helper-module launching and in socket operations.

	Merged all changes from scim-1.4 branch into the trunk and bumped the version 1.4.7->1.4.8.
	I don't believe that branches are useful with such a low activity project as scim is now.

	* Renamed po/pt-BR.po->po/pt_BR.po: renamed po/pt-BR.po to po/pt_BR.po to make it look like other language files.
	* configure.ac: removed 'ta' from languages due to missing po/ta.po
