* Launch the scim-bridge in the "standalone" mode:

Steps:
1. Open a terminal on the X.
2. export the environmental variable, "GTK_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge".
3. Launch "scim-bridge --verbose --standalone".

Expected results:
- The process of "scim-bridge" will be invoked. (You can check this by "ps -A | grep scim-bridge")
- The lockfile, "scim-bridge-<version>.lockfile-<uid>@localhost:<display_number>.<screen_number>" is created under "/tmp" dir.
- The socket, "scim-bridge-<version>.socket-<uid>@localhost:<display_number>.<screen_number>" is created under "/tmp" dir.
- You'll see the startup messages from the scim-bridge.
- "^c" (= ctrl-c) kills the agent process without any error.
- The lockfile and the socket are removed on exiting.



* Launch another process of scim-bridge in the "standalone" mode:

Steps:
1. Open a terminal on the X.
2. export the environmental variable, "GTK_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge".
3. Launch "scim-bridge --verbose --standalone".
4. Open another terminal on the X, and repeat from 2 and 3 on the new terminal.

Expected results:
- The new process will exit automatically with the message of "Another agent is running, exitting...".
- The old process still remains and is kicking.
- The old lockfile and the socket remains under the directory of "/tmp".
