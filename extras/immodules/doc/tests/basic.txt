* Basic tests:

Preparation:
1. Kill all the process of "scim-bridge" before the tests.
2. Confirm that the IME is currently turned off if you use "shared-imengine" mode.
3. Open a terminal on the X.
4. export the environmental variable, "GTK_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge".
5. export the environmental variable, "SCIM_BRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL=9".
6. Launch "gedit".


Steps:
0-1. Confirm that the debug strings are appeared in the terminal.
0-3. Confirm that the IME is still deactivated.
0-4. Type "hello, world!" to check if SCIM-Bridge is correctly loaded.
0-5. Focus in and out the the window, and then type "hello, again".
0-6. Press "ctrl+F" to open the fiding dialog.
0-7. Switch the focus between the dialog and the main window.
0-8. Type other strings to confirm that focus transition is correctly handled.
0-9. Close the fiding dialog with the focus staying on the entry field of it.

Expected results:
- "scim-bridge" will be launched and it'll exit on quitting gedit.
- Nothing special is occured.


Steps:
1-1. Turn on the IME from the menu on the panel. (I use "scim-anthy" in the following case)
1-2. Check if the status display of the panel has been changed.
1-3. Type something to confirm the preedit is correctly shown.
1-4. Move the cursor in the preedit forward and backward.
1-5. Enter the coversation mode, and show the lookup table. The lookup table should be shown just under the cursor.
1-6. Shrink and expand the conversation segments to check the appearance of the preedit is correctly applied.
1-7. Commit it, and see if the string is correctly inserted.
1-8. Focus out the main window with the preedit shown. The preedit should be killed that time.

Expected results:
- Nothing to say.
