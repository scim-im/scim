* Kill a client:

Steps:
1. Open a terminal on the X.
2. export the environmental variable, "GTK_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge".
3. Launch "scim-bridge --verbose --standalone --noexit".
4. Launch "gedit" and "yelp".
5. Kill the client by "sleep 5; killall gedit". Please stay focusing or typing in gedit until it exits.
