* Confirm that the fallback imengine in GTK behaves politely for SCIM:

Steps:
1. Launch gedit on the X.
2. Choose US/Keyboard from SCIM panel, or disable SCIM by "ctrl+space".
3. Type "Ctrl+Shift+123" in gedit. (Ctrl and Shift are pressed while typing 1, 2, and 3)
4. Release Ctrl+Shift.
5. Repeat step3.
6. Click the desktop to focus out gedit.
7. Return the focus on gedit again.
8. Choose SCIM-Anthy or SCIM-Pinyin form SCIM panel.
9. Repeat step3.

Expected results:
- Underlined text, "u123" appears as a preedit in step3.
- The preedit vanished, and the character for U+0123 ("g" with a dash mark) is inserted in step4.
- The preedit canceled in step6.
- No preedit or commitment on gedit in step7.
- Nothing happens in step 9.
