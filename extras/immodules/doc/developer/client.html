            <p class="description">
                The clients of scim-bridge communicates with the agent with utf8 string messages, but you don't have to understand them at all. There are the client library to handle them. All you have to do is to understand how to use this library.
            </p>
            <p class="bullet_in" id="event_loop">Let's learn about the event loop</p>
            <p class="description">
                Most GUI applications have their own event loop.
                The event loop is unique for each process, and all the GUI events are handled in this big loop.
                Immodules could have another thread, but I don't recommand that because most GUI libraries are not "thread-safe".
                You should handle GUI events in the GUI thread and change the preedit only from the same thread.
                The most difficult point is the communication with the agent.
            </p>
            <p class="bullet_in" id="handle">How should I handle messages?</p>
            <p class="description">
                The first step you should do is to add the <em>pool trigger</em> for your GUI library.
                This invokes an event when the message from the agent available.
                Creating another thread to pooling the socket is not recommanded as many GUI library is not thread safe.
                The ancient scim-bridge-0.1.* always has troubles with the violation of the GUI thread policy.
                <p class="caption">Example:</p>
                <pre class="example">

// This function is called while initializing the immodule.
void scim_bridge_client_gtk_initialize ()
{
    ...

    // Try to initialize scim client library.
    if (!scim_bridge_client_initialize ()) {

        // Add the IO channel for the socket.
        messenger_iochannel = g_io_channel_unix_new (scim_bridge_client_get_socket_fd ());

        // Register the IO channel to the GUI event loop, 
        // so that it calls <b>handle_message ()</b> when the message is arrived.
        messenger_event_source = g_io_add_watch (messenger_iochannel, G_IO_IN, &handle_message, NULL);

    } else {
        scim_bridge_perrorln ("Error: Cannot initialize the client library");
        return;
    }

    ...
}
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                In the event handler, you have to read_and_dispatch the message. It reads the message, translate it into C function calls for you. Note, read_and_dispatch might be block itself when there is no message at all.

        // There should be an message arraived.

                Note, some of the functions may block until the agent returns a response, but another message from the agent may interrupt to invoke the helper function while blocking. You might make a serious bug without understanding this feature. :&lt;

                When a new IMContext is allocated, you have to register it to the agent. You can get the unique ID for the IMContext if registration is succeeded. Of course, you also have to unregister it when it's freed. Note, the agent would free all the imcontext of the client when the connection is lost by accidents.

                You can change the way to show the preedit for the client by following function. This is useful especially in the case the agent cannot show the preedit for you; The client can stop the agent showing the preedit and show the one by itself.

                As it says, the agent sometimes ignores the key events. In that case, the client can handle it by itself. If the "A" key is pressed and ignored, the client can commit "A" by its own. Otherwise, the client should not be handle it by its own. There is some arguments about the acclerator key events. Some say that the accelerator key events and nmemonic key events should not be passed the IM but be handled by the clients, while others say that IM should handle all the key events first. There is no standard for this, but I personally believe that the accelerators should be handled by the clients first and be passed to the agent later if it has not been consumed. :)
