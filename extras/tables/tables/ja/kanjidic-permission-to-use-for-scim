Dear Jim,

SuSE Linux 9.2 includes the input method software SCIM
developed by Zhe Su <zsu@novell.com> (I added him to the CC:).

SCIM includes a Japanese input method called 日本式　which converts
kana to kanji according to the Nippon Latin transliteration system.
But on top of that, this input method also supports the input
of kanji via their romanized readings, for example one
can type "hitomi" to get a candidate window for the
following kanji

    hitomi  瞳      0
    hitomi  眸      0
    hitomi  睛      0

and select one to input it into the application.

These readings are in the table Nippon.txt.in in the source code of
the scim-tables package. Nippon.txt.in has apparently been compiled
from KANJIDIC. I attach Nippon.txt.in here for your reference.

The KANJIDIC license at

http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/groups/edrdg/licence.html

states:

 h. may make and distribute modified versions of the files, or works derived
    from the files, under the same conditions applying to verbatim copies. Where
    a modified version or derived work is being made and distributed, the nature
    of the modification and derivation must be made clear in documentation
    accompanying the distribution of the work. (The author of the modified
    version or derived work is encouraged to make any additional information
    information available for inclusion in later versions of the file(s).)

[...]

 k. may use these files as part of, or in association with a software package or
    system. Full acknowledgement of the source of the files must be made both in
    the promotional material, WWW pages and software documentation, and copies
    of the documentation of the files and of this licence statement must be
    included in the distribution. Where the files play a major part in the
    package, e.g. in the case of the package being a dictionary system based on
    the files, prominent reference to the source and status of the files must be
    made on any GUI screens, etc. associated with using the files. In the case
    of the EDICT, JMdict and KANJIDIC files, the following URLs must be used or
    quoted:

[...]

Recently our legal department wondered whether we are allowed to use
this information derived from KANJIDIC in SCIM and how to acknowledge
it properly. I added Juergen Weigert <jw@suse.de> to the CC:, he is
responsible for checking license and copyright issues in SuSE
packages.

So what must we do in case of SCIM? Is it enough to include the
complete page

http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/groups/edrdg/licence.html

in the scim-tables-ja rpm package? That is what we are currently
doing. If we need to do more, what would that be?

I hope that we can continue using EDICT, KANJIDIC and information
derived from those dictionaries.

Yours sincerely,

      Mike

I think for the Nippon.txt.in file, that is quite sufficient. 

If it helps, I hereby give permission for the Japanese readings from the
KANJIDIC, KANJD212 and KANJDIDIC2 files to be used to build data files
for SCIM, provided that use is explained in associated documentation,
e.g. in comments within the files, and a copy of the licence is included
with the distribution of those data files.

In other words, what you are doing now.

I'm curious about the "Nippon Latin transliteration system". Does it do
as much as the usual villains? (Wnn, Canna, ...)

Cheers

Jim
